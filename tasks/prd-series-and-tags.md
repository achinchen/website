# Product Requirements Document: Series and Tags for Articles

## Introduction/Overview

This feature introduces a comprehensive content organization system for the website, implementing both **series** and **tags** functionality. Series enable readers to follow sequences of related articles in a logical order, making it easier to consume multi-part content and allowing the author to showcase grouped articles for professional purposes (e.g., resume). Tags provide flexible categorization allowing articles to belong to multiple topics.

**Key Distinction:**

- **Series**: 1-to-N relationship (multiple articles per series, articles ordered sequentially)
- **Tags**: Many-to-many relationship (multiple tags per article, flexible categorization)

## Goals

1. **Enhanced Content Discovery**: Help readers find and follow related articles in logical sequences
2. **Professional Showcase**: Enable easy sharing of article series for resume and portfolio purposes
3. **Flexible Categorization**: Allow articles to be tagged with multiple topics for better organization
4. **SEO Improvement**: Improve search engine optimization through better content structure
5. **User Engagement**: Increase time on site by encouraging readers to consume complete series

## User Stories

## Functional Requirements

### Series Requirements

1. **Series Creation**: The system must allow articles to be assigned to a series via frontmatter metadata
2. **Series Pages**: The system must generate pages at `/[lang]/posts/series/[series-name]` displaying all articles in that series
3. **Article Ordering**: Articles within a series must be ordered by published date by default, with support for custom ordering
4. **Series Metadata Display**: Individual articles must display series information including:
   - Series name
   - Current article position in series (e.g., "Part 2 of 5")
   - Link to series overview page
5. **Series Navigation**: Articles in a series must include Previous/Next navigation to other articles in the same series
6. **Series Listing**: The system must provide a page listing all available series
7. **Internationalization**: Series names and descriptions must support both English and Chinese translations

### Tags Requirements

8. **Tag Creation**: The system must allow articles to be assigned multiple tags via frontmatter metadata
9. **Tag Pages**: The system must generate pages at `/[lang]/posts/tags/[tag-name]` displaying all articles with that tag
10. **Tag Display**: Individual articles must display associated tags with links to tag pages
11. **Tag Cloud/Listing**: The system must provide a way to discover all available tags
12. **Tag Filtering**: Tag pages must support filtering and sorting of tagged articles
13. **Internationalization**: Tags must support both English and Chinese translations

### Technical Integration Requirements

14. **Contentlayer Integration**: Both series and tags must integrate with the existing Contentlayer configuration
15. **URL Structure**: All new pages must maintain the existing `/[lang]/` i18n URL structure
16. **SEO Optimization**: Series and tag pages must include proper meta tags, structured data, and sitemaps
17. **Performance**: The system must not significantly impact build times or page load speeds

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Complex Series Hierarchies**: No support for nested or sub-series
2. **User-Generated Tags**: No user interface for readers to create or suggest tags
3. **Series Cover Images**: No custom cover images for series (may be added in future iterations)
4. **Advanced Filtering**: No complex filtering combining multiple tags or series
5. **Social Features**: No commenting, rating, or sharing functionality specific to series/tags
6. **Migration Tools**: No automated tools to retroactively organize existing content

## Design Considerations

### Series Display

- Series information should be prominently displayed at the top of articles
- Series navigation should be intuitive and accessible
- Series overview pages should provide a clear reading path

### Tags Display

- Tags should be visually distinct from series information
- Tag pages should feel like filtered views of the main posts listing
- Tag cloud/listing should be discoverable from main navigation

### Responsive Design

- All new pages must work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Series navigation must be touch-friendly on mobile devices

### Accessibility

- All new navigation elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Proper semantic HTML structure for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements

## Technical Considerations

### Frontmatter Schema Extensions

```yaml
# Example article frontmatter
---
title: "Getting Started with React Hooks"
series: "react-hooks-deep-dive"
seriesSlug: "react-hooks-deep-dive" # manually specified
seriesOrder: 1
tags: ["react", "javascript", "frontend", "hooks"] # will be normalized
# ... existing fields
---
```

```yaml
# Example series configuration (separate file or frontmatter)
---
seriesName: "React Hooks Deep Dive"
seriesSlug: "react-hooks-deep-dive" # manually specified
seriesDescription: "A comprehensive guide to React Hooks"
seriesStatus: "ongoing" # or "complete"
# ... other series metadata
---
```

### URL Structure

- Series: `/[lang]/posts/series/[series-slug]`
- Tags: `/[lang]/posts/tags/[tag-slug]`
- Series listing: `/[lang]/series`
- Tags listing: `/[lang]/tags`

### Dependencies

- Must integrate with existing Contentlayer configuration
- Should leverage existing i18n helpers and routing structure
- May require updates to sitemap generation
- Should utilize existing components where possible (e.g., Post/List component)

## Success Metrics

1. **Content Discovery**: 25% increase in average pages per session
2. **Series Engagement**: 60% of readers who start a series read at least 2 articles in that series
3. **Tag Usage**: 80% of articles have at least one tag within 3 months
4. **Professional Impact**: Successful use of series links in professional contexts (resume, portfolio)
5. **SEO Impact**: Improved search rankings for long-tail keywords related to series topics

## Additional Requirements (Based on Clarifications)

### Series Management

18. **Manual Series Slugs**: Series slugs must be manually specified in the series configuration rather than auto-generated
19. **Series Completion Status**: The system must support marking series as "complete" vs "ongoing" with appropriate visual indicators
20. **Cross-Language Synchronization**: Articles in different languages belonging to the same series must maintain the same publication date to ensure consistent ordering

### Tags Management

21. **Tag Normalization**: Tags must be case-insensitive and auto-normalized (e.g., "React" and "react" should be treated as the same tag)

### Analytics Integration

22. **Series/Tag Tracking**: The system must implement analytics tracking for:
    - Series page visits and engagement
    - Series completion rates (readers who finish entire series)
    - Tag page interactions and click-through rates
    - Cross-series navigation patterns

### RSS/Feed Integration

23. **Feed Representation**: Series and tags must be properly represented in RSS feeds and JSON feeds with appropriate metadata
