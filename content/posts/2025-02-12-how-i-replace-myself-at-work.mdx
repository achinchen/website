## Introduce
I have an interesting habit at work—I figure out how to replace myself in the tasks I take on. Admittedly, this isn’t entirely selfless. I simply dislike repetitive work. While I often engage in similar tasks, I enjoy identifying patterns and finding new ways to make them more interesting. Still, I worry that I might eventually lose interest.

## Something about Chin
Before diving into how I do this, let me introduce some personal traits for context, so you don’t see me as just a picky and easily bored person—though I probably am.

I’ve spent over a decade researching myself and know that repetition exhausts me. When stuck in a loop, I switch to autopilot, living and working unconsciously. That’s something I can’t stand. If I don’t know what I’m doing or why, I feel lost in a sea of tasks. Now that you know me a little better, let’s get back to the topic.

## the DRY philosophy
In software, we often hear about DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself. While I don’t fully agree with it in all cases, it fits my work philosophy. When I recognize a recurring pattern in tasks, I ask myself, “Would I want to do this again?” If the answer is no, I break it down into a structured SOP, a simple flowchart, or documentation to help a teammate take over. If no one else is available or the task is mindless, I write a script—whether semi- or fully automated—to minimize the time I spend on it.

## Beyond the surface
More importantly, when preparing to transfer work, I naturally push myself to fully understand the requirements and design, ensuring clarity and quality. This process has sharpened my craftsmanship and benefited me immensely, which is why I want to share it.

And that it is.
In the end, I’ve earned a lot of trust and recognition from teammates—all because I don’t like repeating myself, so I try to be DRY.
