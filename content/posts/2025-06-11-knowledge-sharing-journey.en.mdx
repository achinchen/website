If you’ve ever done technical or knowledge sharing, what topics did you cover?

In [this article](/en/posts/from-stage-fright-to-embracing-the-spotlight), I mentioned how I started sharing knowledge within the org. But back then, I hadn’t yet formed a habit of doing it consistently until this story began, and I ended up running weekly or biweekly knowledge-sharing sessions for two years straight.

<Spacer />

It started in April 2023, when we kicked off the [From Monolithic to Microservices](/en/posts/from-monolithic-to-microservice) project. As the owner, I quickly noticed I was saying the same things over and over… to different people.
For instance, design principles in TypeScript, choosing the right tech stack, structuring monorepos, shifting between library and application mindsets. I’d already explained these things three times… and was asked a fourth.

<Spacer />

Once, I overheard teammates chatting during a design review:

> “I don’t think this would pass Chin’s review. She mentioned this in my last PR…”

<Spacer />

And I thought—why don’t I just share this _once_, with _everyone_?

So I decided to document what I’d been repeating, turn it into a weekly talk, and invite folks to join. Centralized info, less repetition—it sounded perfect. (Of course, reality had other plans.)

## The Shift and the Anxiety

I began logging key project discussions each week not just technical concepts, but the reasoning behind design choices, even tiny things like “why we added this lint rule,” as long as they triggered interesting debates.

At first, everything flowed.
Content came naturally. Feedback was positive.
I also gathered frequently asked questions and turned them into future topics.

After a month or two, even frontends outside the platform team wanted to join.
I welcomed them in.
That’s when things changed.

<Spacer />

The small internal session turned into a frontend-wide presentation.
And with that shift came pressure.

Some engineers didn’t share the same background or day-to-day tasks.
What used to be casual and fun turned into performance anxiety.

Was I being too superficial?
Too boring?

Each week, I worried about what to present.
Preparing talks became a source of stress, not joy.

At some point, I asked myself:

> “Do these sessions actually matter to anyone?”

## Returning to the Why

So what was the original goal?

The knowledge sharing wasn’t about performance.
It was about solving communication pain points.

If the pressure was high and the value unclear, the right move wasn’t to “push through”.
It was to pause and **rediscover the purpose**.

<Spacer />

I realized: I didn’t need to know all the answers.
I just needed to ask better questions.

So I created a survey to collect feedback and topic suggestions.

And the results?

Let me humbly (not-so-humbly) brag for a second:

- Interest in topics: 8.1/10
- Delivery style: 9.6/10
- Would recommend: 10/10

<Spacer />

But more important than the numbers was the signal:
**This format was working.**
Now all I needed were better topics.

I selected a few suggestions and hosted a small focus group.
We discussed each topic, clarified what people _really_ wanted to learn, and voted on which ones resonated most.

From there, I created a topic queue.
I was still the speaker, but the direction came from the audience.

## Three Lessons from Two Years of Sharing

Over the two years of hosting this series, I learned a lot:

#### It’s not about what _I_ want to say, but what I can _offer_

Sometimes, you don’t realize what you _don’t_ know until you try to teach it.
These sessions forced me to examine my blind spots, transforming intuition into explainable, transferable knowledge.

#### I learned more than anyone else

To explain well, I had to:

- Deconstruct designs
- Read alternative implementations
- Rebuild my own logic chains

The talks became a learning cycle, many of my own technical roadblocks became next week’s topic.

#### Efficiency through time constraints

Midway through the year, I added a constraint:
No more than **90 minutes of prep** for a **50-minute session**.

This sharpened my ability to structure content quickly.
It improved not just my talks, but also my skill in writing proposals and designing systems.

## Sharing Doesn’t Have to Be a Stage

Beyond the sessions themselves, I spent these two years wondering—

> “Do I still want to be a software engineer?”

I had doubts.
Maybe I should try something else?

But the more I hosted, the more I realized I still had so much I wanted to share.
System design, team communication, tech evaluation, these still spark excitement.

I still want to understand _why_ one design is better than another.
I still want to articulate and pass that knowledge on.

That desire to know, to express, to connect might just be the answer.

<Spacer />

In the end, knowledge sharing doesn’t have to mean public speaking, or polished articles, or YouTube videos. Sometimes, it’s just a way to avoid explaining the same thing for the fourth time and in doing so, you accidentally build a space where everyone learns together.

Somewhere along the way, I found myself in that process.

And I began to realize the kind of **Staff Engineer** I want to become: Maybe a bit idealistic, but someone who dreams of a team where learning is natural, mutual, and lasting.
