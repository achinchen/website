Does recognition at work mean things will finally calm down?

Not quite.

Being seen often means being trusted with even more difficult challenges.
At least, that’s what happened to me.

<Spacer />

After a reorg, I was handed the responsibility to lead the refactor of our **critical monolithic service** into a [**Monorepo + Microservices** architecture](/en/posts/from-monolithic-to-microservice).

Why? Because the previous success made engineers happy, product managers happy, leadership happy—and R, my manager, very happy.

So naturally, he wanted to apply the same architecture to our most important system.

<Spacer />

And me?
Honestly, I was resistant.
But I couldn’t leave the company just yet.
So even though I felt like I was surrendering, I took the assignment… and looked for a way forward. (Just kidding… maybe.)

This time, though, things didn’t go so smoothly.
Let’s just say: there were *complications*.


## When Idealism Meets Reality

Let’s talk about that critical legacy system.

Bloated, historically messy, tangled with deeply coupled logic—it was a minefield of technical debt.

<Spacer />

I thought: this is the biggest architectural debt we’ve got.
Sooner or later, we’ll have to face it.

So I approached it from first principles:
- Start with interface-driven modularization.
- Avoid shared instances.
- Refactor toward loose coupling.

I even designed an idealized decoupling strategy—hoping to clean up our mixed usage patterns once and for all.

<Spacer />


Technically, it was correct.
But it was *too* ideal.

Faced with inconsistent usage, legacy decisions, and fuzzy module boundaries, this was less a refactor and more a full rewrite.


## Back to the Reality

Wanting to grow the team, I gave our members autonomy—hoping they could apply the architecture knowledge we’d built in the previous phase.

But during an OKR retro, we all admitted it: progress had stalled.

So we scheduled a meeting to get aligned and reassess.

<Spacer />

What we realized was this:
The problem wasn’t that we weren’t working hard enough.
It was that we were trying to do *too much at once*.


The project included:
- A framework upgrade
- A switch from JavaScript to TypeScript
- An architecture overhaul
- Infrastructure changes
- Deployment strategy updates

<Spacer />

Everything was tightly coupled.
It wasn’t a codebase—it was quicksand.

Everyone was working, everyone was delivering,
but we couldn’t feel the progress.
Because the *next step* always held the real results.


<Spacer />

I reflected on my own role.

As PO and Tech Lead, I gave space—but not enough structure.
Time is a form of management.
Without clear boundaries, our idealism became collective burnout.

Support and trust are crucial,
but so are focus and scope control.


<Spacer />

The biggest lesson?

That *perfect* technical solution I had obsessed over—
it distracted me from solving the urgent problems right in front of us.

Understanding the optimal path is a sign of technical maturity.
But sustaining delivery is what actually moves the business.

Knowing when to abandon elegance for progress is seniority.

<Spacer />

So we changed the strategy.

From: “Can we finish this?”
To: “Can we get something usable?”

We started with the foundations:

* Establish Monorepo
* Build reliable CI/CD
* Document clearly
* Provide reusable migration scripts

We ensured every contributor started on the same page.


## From Me to We

Each phase of delivery wasn’t just “done”—
it was *usable*, *deployable*, and *handover-ready*.

We moved in small, verifiable units.
We broke down features, introduced clear processes,
and built confidence—step by step.

We stayed closely aligned with product teams,
listening to feedback and adjusting direction.
Our goal wasn’t to prove what we could build,
but to make everyone’s job *easier*.

<Spacer />

This effort created the foundation for future scalable implementation.

It gave the architecture **resilience** and allowed us to:

* Deliver in stages
* Decouple services incrementally
* Maintain a healthy Monorepo workflow
* Enable seamless onboarding across teams

This wasn’t just about *speed*.
It gave the org structural flexibility to scale people and systems.



## A Staff Engineer Isn’t the Fastest

That’s when I began asking myself:

> If I left tomorrow, could this still run without me?

So I translated the logic in my head into:

* Decision logs
* Implementation guides
* Shared technical standards

I helped team members understand historical context and modular design principles—
so knowledge could flow and accumulate.

<Spacer />

My solo project became **a team memory**.

Honestly? That shift—from burning myself out
to designing sustainable collaboration—
was one of the most meaningful transformations of my career.

Yes, it hurt a bit.
But it was a gift.

The real lesson from this project wasn’t about ticking off long-planned milestones.

<Spacer />

It was finally understanding a phrase I’d heard a hundred times:

> *“If you want to go far, go together.”*

That doesn’t just happen naturally.
It takes **intentional design** and **deliberate investment**.

As a Staff Engineer,
you’re not the one running the fastest.
You’re the one building the road so others can keep going.

Do I know how to do this perfectly every time?
No.
But I know I’m getting closer by doing one project at a time.
