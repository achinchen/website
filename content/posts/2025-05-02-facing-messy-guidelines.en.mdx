## What Would You Do?

How does your team define *coding guidelines* or *team conventions*? Were they already in place when you joined? Or were they developed over time?

If existing rules now result in high maintenance costs and are likely to create more chaos in the future, what would you do?

I don’t know what your answer would be—but here’s what I did.

I’ve had experience building team collaboration culture from scratch, as well as revising existing conventions. But nothing compares to this particular journey. Let me tell you why.

## The First Wall After Onboarding

After onboarding, engineers usually want to show their immediate impact, right?

I was no different. I remember my first few deliveries went smoothly, but when it came time to align with the coding guidelines, I hit a wall. The team’s suggested writing style left me confused. I didn’t know where to draw *boundaries* or how to interpret the code clearly, since even code written around the same time followed different styles.

What would you do?

* A: This codebase is a mess—just write and move on.
* B: It feels off, but let’s ship first and maybe discuss it later.
* C: Something’s not right. I’m going to change it.

At first, I felt A. Then I settled into B. Eventually, I acted on C.

**The end.**

Not Really.


## The Problem Is Lack of Resolution

Let me explain.

At first, I didn’t fully understand the rationale behind the coding guidelines. Still, I consciously accepted the status quo—I needed to earn *credit* and show professional capability. But I also began talking to teammates to understand more.

<Spacer />

> Why does our codebase have different styles in the same period?
> Is it because of business needs—or just legacy code inconsistencies?
> Should we set aside time to refactor? Or adjust as we extend features?

> What principle drives our style decisions?
> If it’s extensibility, do we still agree that’s our top priority today?

<Spacer />
I discovered that everyone had their own thoughts. Some great discussions had happened during *review phases*, but never reached the team level. Other interesting conversations were buried in old threads without conclusions.

To me, **both are equivalent to having no resolution**:

The former stays between reviewer and author, others never see or agree to it.
The latter is like watching a debate at a night market—lively but directionless.

> Without a shared conclusion, code reviews won’t help us grow. They just deepen the inconsistency.

## Proposal

I approached **R** (my longtime engineering manager) and asked:
Is it true that most technical discussions in our team don’t reach a conclusion?

He said yes.

So I told him I wanted to try proposing something—demonstrating my preferred approach to team discussions.

I picked a previously archived small style issue, gathered feedback, consolidated opinions, and got consensus.
I then defined two **action items**:

- Update the coding guideline document
- Adjust linter rules

Only after completing both did I consider the proposal **fully implemented**.

<Spacer />

Following that success, I introduced a proposal for how we do proposals. 
The process had four phases:

- Proposal
Background of the issue, related research. Suggested approach and sample code

- Discussion
Like an RFC, open to all team members. Agreement is marked; disagreement must be supported with reasoning. Discussion continues until consensus.

- Conclusion
Proposal owner consolidates consensus and action items. Final review allows for objections and resolution before implementation

- Action
Proposal owner executes the action items, optionally with collaborators. If extra resources are needed, the EM steps in. Only after actions are complete is the proposal considered done

## This Became the New Norm

Though the process may seem heavy, surprisingly, **everyone began adopting this structure in their own proposals**.

It gave direction to every technical discussion and helped decisions stick.

I didn’t know it at the time, but this approach—*analyzing root issues, clarifying decision-making, and resolving via structured processes would later become my defining trait as an engineer, and a key reason I grew into a Staff role.
