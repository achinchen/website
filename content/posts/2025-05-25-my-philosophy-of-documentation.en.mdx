**Documentation, oh documentation
How many use your "outdated" reputation as an excuse not to write you at all?**

<Spacer />

Hi. Do you write documentation?
If you do, how did you start?


I still remember the first time I was asked to write documentation at work.
Back then, my manager wasn’t exactly encouraging engineers to write docs.

Why?

Well, probably because documentation needs regular updates—or else it becomes stale.
Worse, outdated or conflicting information creates a mess that’s more harmful than helpful.

<Spacer />

Would you have just accepted that answer?

I couldn’t.

For me, thinking things through is important. 
Besides, the manager wasn’t banning it outright—just… not promoting it. That’s a pretty big difference.

I guess I’m the kind of person who likes to push the edge of what’s allowed.

That’s when I began a line of thought I’d later call:
**What documentation means to software engineering.**


## Start with “Software Engineering”

Let’s break this down: documentation, software engineering, meaning.

Some of these are abstract—too fuzzy to tackle first—so I started with the more concrete part:
“Software engineering.”

Have you ever stopped to ask yourself: *What exactly is software engineering?*

In my search for answers, I came across a quote I really liked—from David Lorge Parnas, a pioneer of the field who coined *information hiding*:

> *“Software engineering is the multi-person development of multi-version programs.”*

In other words, **software engineering is the act of building evolving programs as a team**. Even if you're a solo developer, you’re still collaborating with your past, present, and future selves.

So being a software engineer isn’t just about writing code.
It’s about doing it well in a world of shifting versions and multiple contributors.


## Then, Let’s Talk About Documentation

So what *is* documentation?

Some say self-documenting code is a required skill—and a key difference between developers and engineers.
But that still doesn’t answer the question: *What is documentation?*

In practice, it comes in many forms—README files, API docs, test reports, specs, diagrams.
It can be text, images, tables, flowcharts, or a mix of all those.

But in the context of software engineering, documentation is tightly connected to the core nature of the work:
**multi-person, multi-version collaboration**.

In an environment where people and code are constantly evolving,
documentation becomes a bridge across **time and turnover**.

Maybe that’s the true meaning of documentation in software engineering.


## From Concept to Strategy

I know this all might sound a bit abstract.
But for me, laying out a clear thought process helps me ground decisions in principles—not just vibes.

In my last job, I managed to convince my manager to stop blocking docs by minimizing the cost of writing them.
But I still felt like I was operating on instinct.

Yes, I could make case-by-case decisions.
Yes, I could win over key stakeholders.
But did I have an actual **documentation investment strategy**?

Especially when time is limited, how do you prioritize what’s worth documenting?

So in this job, when the topic of documentation came up again, I wanted to find a framework that created value for both engineering and the business.

Because not all documentation carries the same weight.
Beyond deliverables, I wanted the act of documenting to *mean something*.

## Three Angles to Evaluate Documentation

I realized that while my previous manager had certain concerns, my current one had others.
But both cared about team efficiency and organizational value.

So I broke the problem down into three dimensions:

- A. Lifecycle
Some documents are short-lived (e.g., project notes); others persist over time.
Understanding the *expected lifespan* helped me think more clearly about maintenance effort and ownership boundaries.

- B. Frequency of Questions
The more frequently something is asked, the more valuable it is to document.
Not only does this save time, it also surfaces **knowledge gaps**.
If a single person becomes a knowledge bottleneck, it’s time to **horizontally scale** by documenting and distributing the knowledge.

- C. Risk Level
Some topics rarely come up—but when they do, mistakes are catastrophic.
These are like evacuation manuals: seldom used, but *must* be reliable when needed.


## Reducing the Friction of Writing

Once I knew *what* to document, the next challenge was *how*.

I didn’t want to rely on instinct and willpower every time.
And I didn’t want to be the only person writing.

So I borrowed from requirement and design review workflows and tried to turn documentation into a **collaborative process**.

- A. Define the purpose before writing
Who is this for? When will they read it?
What problem does it solve? What’s their technical background? What boundaries are in/out of scope?

- B. Start with an outline, not a finished doc
This makes it easier to review and avoids overwhelming readers.
It also lowers the cost of feedback and encourages early alignment.

- C. Separate detail from structure
Focus on the reader’s *task*. Move tangents or extra details to references or FAQs to keep the main content clean and digestible.


## Documentation as a Bridge—and a Dialogue

As I worked on reducing the friction of writing, I realized something unexpected:

Documentation isn’t just an output.
The process of writing it is an opportunity to **facilitate discussion and build alignment**.

Collaborating on outlines or examples helps uncover mismatched assumptions.
It turns vague disagreements into something concrete.

Docs become more than just repositories of knowledge.
They become tools to drive **conversation**, challenge **assumptions**, and align **mental models**.

In that sense, documenting is just another form of version control—
but for *team understanding*.


## Back to the Original Question

Hi again. 

Do you write documentation?
How did you start?

I no longer ask whether we *should* document,
but rather **what’s worth documenting**, **how to write meaningfully**,
and **how to use that process to give our teams more clarity and direction**.

Because documentation isn't just a means of knowledge transfer—
it’s how we make sure that knowledge isn’t trapped inside overworked experts.

The meaning of documentation in software engineering might just lie in the little choices we make:

- What to preserve.
- Who we preserve it for.
- And how we do it.

And the sum of those choices.
That’s part of what makes us software engineers.

<Spacer />

Do I know whether this way of thinking will lead me to who I want to become?
No.
I certainly didn’t expect it to get me close to a Staff-level role—at least not so soon.

But maybe that’s how it starts.
