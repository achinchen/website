## Initial Preparations

When you start onboarding as a **senior engineer** at a new company, what preparations do you typically make?

If you're working _in-house_, maybe having your favorite cup and keyboard matters. But for software engineers, regardless of working location, the first real task is usually **setting up your development environment**.

This setup might involve familiar or unfamiliar operating systems and programming languages. In such a blind exploration, having clear documentation to guide environment setup is invaluable.

## Evaluating Documentation

What catches your attention first when you begin reading such a document? Is it the _logical order_ of sections or the environmental requirements?

For me, I usually start with evaluating the **logical flow** of the document.

If the headings of the document look inconsistent, it might be because the author lacks a clear concept of guiding the reader, or worse, simply doesn't care and just writes down whatever comes to mind. Perhaps the team doesn't have a habit of reviewing documentation; otherwise, there should at least be basic adjustments, like arranging headings from H1 to H3 logically.

To me at that time, this was undoubtedly a **red flag**.

Why?

Because people who write documentation may not necessarily be senior engineers, but they are likely trusted domain experts responsible for documenting critical knowledge.

If these people don't care about their readers, there's a risk they won't care about future collaboration either.

If the team accepts such a situation, no matter how excellent the manager or members are, it introduces potential variables that could complicate future collaboration.

As expected, with skepticism, I continued setting up the environment until I hit a roadblock installing **Docker**.

As a **frontend engineer**, I found it odd that I needed to set up the backend environment locally when we already had an internal development environment separating frontend and backend concerns.

But as a new team member, it's normal to wonder if I might have missed something. So, I budgeted two hours to troubleshoot, updating documentation as I progressed, and kept my engineering manager (and future long-term manager) **R** in the loop.

After successfully setting up the backend and updating the onboarding documentation, I received a message: _most frontend engineers no longer set up the backend environment locallyâ€”the documentation was outdated._

## How Would You React?

How would you react in such a situation?

- Would you shrug it off since the environment is already set up and move on?
- Would you mentally mark a negative impression and rate the onboarding process as ðŸ‘Ž?
- Or would you think, _"This onboarding process sucks, but I'll fix it"_?

I chose the last one, perhaps because I'm somewhat stubborn.

Why else would this onboarding be even more cumbersome than my previous job? At my previous company, due to specific project technology choices, setting up both frontend and backend environments locally was genuinely necessary.

With two additional years of experience, feeling stuck again made me dissatisfiedâ€”both with the team and myself.

## Taking Initiative

Though my primary role was product development, I proactively proposed using some spare time to revise the documentation, improving **readability and usability**, eliminating scenarios where you must read through the entire document to understand what's essential, and resolving redundancy and awkward dependencies across documents.

Little did I know, this collaboration would become the cornerstone of my next **four years**.

Initially, I simply wanted to improve an uncomfortable situation, so I submitted a basic proposal to **R**. He responded with questions about readability issues and expectations for future documentation.

These queries taught me a valuable lesson: to gain buy-in, clearly explain the reasoning behind actions. I adjusted accordingly, supplemented my proposal with background information, and explained the rationale behind the new structure.

After updating the documentation as proposed, I returned to my regular development duties.

## After the Onboarding

Five months later, before a new colleague joined, **R** asked me to ensure the environment setup documentation was current. I invited several colleagues for a review. They casually mentioned that the **project structure** and **coding guidelines** seemed outdated and wondered if those could be refreshed as well.

If you were me, would you accept this additional task?

I think I accepted because I saw an opportunity to discover more issues needing team discussion. These topics arose naturally from development frustrations and uncertainties. As I updated each document, I drafted proposals, collected feedback, revised them accordingly, and finally secured explicit approval from each team member to complete the task.

Only later did I realize that resolving uncertainty became my **unique strength** within the team.

But at the time, _who knew_?
