## Background

Recently, I decided to quit my job and hosted several AMA meetings. One standout question was:

“What is the legacy and accomplishment you made in this company? What do you want them to inherit?”

I simply replied, “Nope.”

Then, I explained my reasoning. While I achieved things—like introducing a monorepo to the frontend team—I don’t wish for anything to be fixed in place. Every decision was made based on the context and constraints of that time. If things remain unchanged years later, it signals stagnation rather than growth.

## A Story to Illustrate My Perspective

During our monorepo migration, we started with CSS framework unification. At the time, we used 3–4 UI libraries, creating unnecessary cognitive load for engineers. But why start here?

When evaluating an upgrade from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3, I realized the complexity and high risk involved. To mitigate this, we agreed to split services first, reducing risk before tackling the migration. As a prerequisite, we kicked off CSS framework standardization to ensure a smoother transition.

Through this, we learned the value of gaining consensus upfront, making data-driven scope adjustments, and planning incremental next steps.

## Building for Adaptability, Not Permanence
Following this, I led monorepo adoption, starting with a new service built on React and TypeScript. To maintain development velocity, I drove the CI/CD setup for monorepo projects. This success validated monorepo’s impact on engineering efficiency, enabling us to progressively split the major monolithic service into microservices.

As a result, the team became proficient in CI/CD, whether for a simple polyrepo or a complex monorepo. We delivered a minimum infrastructure and core libraries in the new monorepo, iterating progressively while showcasing team contributions.

Throughout this process, I never fixated on a specific solution, workflow, or architecture. Instead, I encouraged the team to adapt to future changes rather than cling to past results.

I remind myself:
> Never fall in love with one’s code or design.

Its value lies in how well it served its purpose—no more, no less. What I leave behind is not a rigid system but a team equipped to navigate future transformations.

And that’s why I answered, “Nope.”
