## Do You Care About Company Culture?

I’m not sure whether company culture matters to you.
But for me, it significantly influences whether I accept an offer.

People value different things. For some, culture may not be a top priority—and that's perfectly fine.
There’s no right or wrong here, just personal preference.

But I think of it this way:
If a company’s stated values already feel off to me, then working there long term could cost me more—mentally and physically than whatever salary difference there is between offers.

That’s the kind of concern I carry even before starting a new job.

## Compensation, Systems, and Observing What Matters

What about after I join?

My observations differ from company to company, largely because I'm at different stages of my life each time.
Beyond teamwork and collaboration, I believe salary structures and performance systems offer concrete insight into what a company truly values.

Looking at things from this perspective helps me gather practical information, so I can decide whether this is a place I want to stay.

Now, if salary data is fully transparent, what would you do with it?
- Would you ignore it altogether?
- Would you compare your comp with peers at your level?
- Or… would you try to find out who the highest-paid engineer is in your discipline?

## Who’s the Highest-Paid Engineer?

I chose to look into the top-paid engineer.
To my surprise, I found out that **V**, a Senior Staff Engineer, had a cash compensation on par with most C-suite execs.

It was rare to see an IC paid the same as a manager.
The fact that the company was willing to offer that kind of compensation suggested that **V had earned the organization's full trust**. 

I still remember the first time V came up to me, sometime during my first month, and asked:
“What kind of engineer do you want to become?”

I replied,
“I’m still figuring that out, but for now I’d like to seriously pursue the IC path.”

Then he followed up with,
“Have you found your career model here?”

I answered confidently:
“No, I haven’t.”

What I didn’t say out loud was this:
Even though I hadn’t found a complete role model at this company, I’ve always liked borrowing traits and skills from others—piecing together my own version of the kind of engineer I want to be.

So after discovering V was the most expensive engineer, I started studying him.
Not out of flattery, but because I genuinely wanted to understand what made him so valuable and whether there was anything I could learn (or even steal).

## Studying Through Writing

Why did I begin my observation through his project documentation?

Partly because we didn’t have many opportunities to collaborate directly.
But also because I naturally have a sensitivity to language and structure, so analyzing written materials just made sense.

After reading several of his research docs, I noticed this:

* V never just relied on the requestor’s initial input.
  He would always revisit the background, redefine the problem space, and frame the research goal clearly.
* He explored problems from multiple angles and consistently presented **at least two viable options** each backed with multidimensional analysis outlining trade-offs, risks, and feasibility.
* His recommendations were always grounded in context.

If I were his collaborator, I’d feel very reassured working with someone that methodical and composed.

What stood out to me even more was the **readability**.
Even when his docs were long, they never felt heavy.
They flowed.

Compared to other documents I had read, V’s clearly reflected an effort not just to explain things, but to **drive understanding and enable action** through writing.

## From Imitation to Foundation

So I tried to do the same.

Over the following months, I made a conscious effort to:

* Investigate the root context behind every problem
* Break things down methodically
* Always bring **at least two proposals** for discussion
* Bridge any information gaps through documentation—so no stakeholder would feel lost

What started as a deliberate imitation gradually helped me define **my own standards for clarity, granularity, and communication**.
I developed a way of using writing to facilitate decisions, guide collaboration, and make my thought process visible.

This became the foundation for how I approached project research and how I evaluated my own deliverables.

## Assembling My Own Model

I’m not sure I ever fully “stole” everything from V.
But I do believe I pieced together a version of professional, mature communication that feels truly my own.

While V might not represent everything I hope to become as an engineer, his research and discipline gave me a reliable cornerstone that ultimately helped me earn trust from peers and recognition from R (my manager).

To be honest, I never imagined myself becoming a Staff Engineer.
At least not this quickly, and not in this job.

But looking back, it all makes sense.
