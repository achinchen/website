Nearly four years into this journey, becoming a Staff Engineer didn’t dramatically change how I felt. 

But as I look back, there are two lessons I’ve grown to deeply appreciate—ones I’d like to leave here, for anyone reading, and for my future self.

## Always Make Yourself Replaceable

We're often taught to build irreplaceable value at work, to make ourselves indispensable. But let’s be honest:
How many things in this world are *truly* irreplaceable?

To me, being stuck in something “only you can do” creates several risks:

1. Your manager may keep you there indefinitely
2. You might not grow because there’s no chance to take on new challenges
3. You lose perspective and miss the opportunity to think beyond your current responsibilities

Doing something well is one thing.
Designing it so that someone else *can* do it—that’s another level.

Writing documentation, designing processes, mentoring others, these aren’t just time investments. They represent **freedom**.

They show that you have the ability to reduce complexity, streamline workflows, and transfer your knowledge.

The key is to intentionally place yourself in a mindset that asks:

> If someone else replaces me today, where would I go next?
> If I’m this easily replaced, isn’t that inevitable—if not now, then soon?

Paradoxically, embracing this possibility creates growth.
It breaks the boundaries of your comfort zone.
It makes space for new challenges, new directions, and a version of yourself you haven’t yet become.

<Spacer />

I don’t want to become the kind of engineer who’s just jaded and set in their ways.

Two birthdays ago, I wished to become “someone who understands the world but chooses not to be cynical.”
That still holds true.


## No Right or Wrong—Only Difference

People love binary thinking.
Right vs wrong. Black vs white. Yes vs no.

As engineers, we’re trained to reduce things to logic. But we’re not machines.
And in these four years, I’ve learned there’s far more to the world than 0 and 1.

<Spacer />

When you let go of judging everything as right or wrong,
you unlock—yes, I’m going to use this cliché—**infinite possibilities**.

Without the need to assign blame or defend correctness, we stop wasting time on emotional friction.
We move from finger-pointing to real problem-solving:
- What are we actually trying to fix?
- Why do we see things differently?
- How can we align for the future?

In that space—where “right” and “wrong” are no longer weapons—we get closer to each other.

<Spacer />

I love this quote from *I May Be Wrong*:
> “Beyond ideas of right and wrong, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.”

When we stop trying to control everything, we can see our work—and life—more clearly.

<Spacer />

You might ask: “Why call it a delusion to want control?”

Because total control is impossible.
The belief that we can control *everything* is, by definition, a delusion.

And yeah, you might be thinking: “Wait, wasn’t this supposed to be a tech article? Why are we getting all philosophical?”

Because, on the road to becoming a Staff Engineer,
the hardest part wasn’t the technology.

Honestly, building a solid technical foundation that’s something anyone aiming for senior+ can learn and do.

Letting go of control?
**That’s much harder.**
But if you can do it, the road becomes a lot more comfortable.


## Learning to Accept Imperfection

I don’t know if you’re a “J” or a “P” type of person (Judging vs Perceiving, for the MBTI folks).

When I first entered the workforce, I was the kind of traveler who planned every trip detail to perfection. But when things didn’t go as expected, I’d get frustrated. The trip became stressful instead of joyful—because reality didn’t follow my script.

I’m not here to tell you how I’ve grown since then.
but I *do* want to share this thought:
> The tighter you grip something, the harder it is to let go when it slips.

<Spacer />

We make every decision with the best information we have at that moment.
And when new information arrives, it’s okay to *update*.

No one resents a safe and harmless system update, right? 😄

<Spacer />

So why tie our identity to every past decision?
Why let “being right” define us at work?

Some differences can be resolved.
Some don’t even need resolving. (Just whisper that part.)

So relax a little. (:


## Being as Resilient as the Systems I Design

Over these past four years, I’m grateful for everything—
the opportunities, the challenges, the growth.

And above all, I want to become like the systems I try to build:
**resilient.**

If you’ve made it through this series—thank you.
I hope you took something with you.
And if you’d like to share it with me, I’d be absolutely thrilled.
