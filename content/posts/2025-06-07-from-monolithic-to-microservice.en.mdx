Opportunities rarely come announced.
Can you recognize one when it shows up?

Honestly, Iâ€™m not always sure I can.
But this time, I didâ€”and it became the inflection point for introducing microservices at our company.

<Spacer />

It all started in the months following [this story about avoiding team burnout](/en/posts/avoid-team-burnout).
Not long after we wrapped that project, the team experienced a significant wave of resignations, morale dropped, direction felt unclear, and watching great colleagues leave one after another, I seriously considered quitting too.

But due to personal circumstances, I couldnâ€™t leave just yet.
Still, I didnâ€™t want to be a warm-body paycheck thief either.
So I started scheduling 1:1s with engineers from other teams, hoping conversations might reveal new possibilities.

<Spacer />

One of those chats was with K, an engineering manager and longtime collaborator.
He mentioned that the product team wanted to rebuild our customer support system.
But if that wasnâ€™t possible, theyâ€™d have to shove it into an aging legacy systemâ€”a known nightmare.

My gut reaction? Please, anything but that.

But then another thought immediately surfaced:

> Waitâ€¦ isnâ€™t this the perfect chance to push for **Monorepo-based microservices**?

## A Strategic Pilot

So K and I worked together on a proposal:
Use **Monorepo architecture** to build the new support system.

This wasnâ€™t just a technical decisionâ€”it was a strategic move toward microservices.

Back during the [failed upgrade project](/en/posts/turn-frustration-into-team-alignment), I had already done significant research:
service decomposition, shared micro-frontend strategies, monorepo vs. polyrepo trade-offs.
But theory alone means little without implementation.

The company had long relied on a monolithic architecture. Unless you could prove massive ROI, new architecture proposals rarely got approved. But this support system belonged to a non-core domainâ€”no existing service to migrate, no immediate user pressure. It was the perfect low-stakes environment to test Monorepo and service separation strategies.

<Spacer />

We started fresh with a new repo, using it to validate our CICD pipelines and assess whether Monorepo could deliver clearer development workflows and better scalability.

This wasnâ€™t just infrastructureâ€”it was a testbed for everything Iâ€™d been preparing for.

Of course, there was real pressure too:
If this Monorepo rollout failed, it would be *much* harder to make the case again.
If the support system didnâ€™t meet expectations under the new setup, who would trust this architecture for their projects?

This wasnâ€™t just a tech risk.
It had implications for team morale and future adoption.
I wanted the project to deliver not just a usable system, but a proof point that **architectural transformation could improve delivery** and be worth investing in.


## First Wins

Fortunately, this story had a strong start.

As **Project Owner**, I was responsible for ensuring our Monorepo setup could support real-world service development.
K and I collaborated on breaking down the support system roadmap.
I reviewed system designs, mapped out the microservice infrastructure we needed, and partnered with the newly formed platform team to get things built.

To ensure the architecture aligned with actual product needs, I joined early product team planning sessions. That let me collect feedback and adjust the architecture accordingly.

In exchange, I supported delivery planning for the support system itselfâ€”because customer success = architectural success ðŸ˜„

<Spacer />

We did hit friction.

That led to a [two-year internal knowledge-sharing initiativeâ€”60+ sessions](/en/posts/knowledge-sharing-journey), reshaping our team culture. (But thatâ€™s a story for another time.)

Through this pilot, we built a team that could handle complex CICD, design internal code conventions, build architecture libraries, and deliver services.
The successful first release of this client-facing system formally established Monorepo as our new standardâ€”and gave the company real, visible proof of its value.

More teams followed.


## Team-Level and Personal Shift

Ironically, it was the very inability to quit that forced me to find a breakthrough.
The result? A long-standing dreamâ€”**pushing microservices**â€”became reality.

This wasnâ€™t just about scalability or developer experience.
It marked a step change for our engineering team.
One where we were finally equipped to take on more complex, evolving challenges.

<Spacer />

In both product design and delivery process, this experience reinforced one of my core beliefs in software engineering:

> Resilience isnâ€™t just a goalâ€”itâ€™s a foundation.

<Spacer />


And by treating this as a training ground, I gave teammates a chance to grow through meaningful challengesâ€”gaining skills theyâ€™d carry with them well beyond this project.

That unspoken impact was one of my proudest deliverables.
All of this started because I didnâ€™t want to sit around doing the bare minimum.

<Spacer />

After this project, I was officially promoted to **Staff Engineer**.
Though that came with its own new question:
> Am I *really* ready to be a Staff?
