Opportunities rarely announce themselves.

Can you recognize one when it shows up?

Iâ€™m not always sure I can.  
But this time, I didâ€”and it became the turning point for introducing microservices at our company.


## From Burnout Recovery to Possibility

It started in the months after [avoiding team burnout](/en/posts/avoid-team-burnout).  
Not long after we wrapped that project, a wave of resignations hit.  
Morale dropped. Direction felt unclear. Watching great colleagues leave one by one, I seriously considered quitting too.

But due to personal circumstances, I couldnâ€™t leave yet.  
Still, I didnâ€™t want to be a warm-body paycheck collector.

So I began scheduling 1:1s with engineers from other teams, hoping conversations might uncover new possibilities.


## The Chance Conversation

One chat was with K, an engineering manager Iâ€™d worked with before.  
He mentioned the product team wanted to rebuild our customer support system.  
If that wasnâ€™t possible, theyâ€™d have to shove it into an aging legacy systemâ€”a known nightmare.

My gut reaction? Please, anything but that.  
Then another thought hit me:

> Isnâ€™t this the perfect chance to push for **Monorepo-based microservices**?


## A Strategic Pilot

K and I proposed building the new support system on **Monorepo architecture**.

This wasnâ€™t just a technical decisionâ€”it was a strategic move toward microservices.

Back during the [failed upgrade project](/en/posts/turn-frustration-into-team-alignment), Iâ€™d researched service decomposition, micro-frontend strategies, and monorepo vs. polyrepo trade-offs.  
But theory is nothing without implementation.

The company had relied on a monolithic architecture for years.  
Without proof of massive ROI, new architecture proposals rarely got approved.  
But this support system was non-coreâ€”no existing service to migrate, no heavy user pressureâ€”making it the perfect low-stakes environment to test Monorepo and service separation strategies.

We started fresh with a new repo, using it to validate our CICD pipelines and assess whether Monorepo could deliver clearer workflows and better scalability.

It was the testbed Iâ€™d been waiting for.

The risk?  
If Monorepo failed here, convincing others to try again would be far harder.  
If the support system didnâ€™t meet expectations, trust in the architecture would drop to zero.

This was more than tech riskâ€”it was a bet on team morale and future adoption.  
I wanted the project to deliver not just a usable system, but proof that **architectural transformation could improve delivery** and be worth investing in.


## First Wins

As **Project Owner**, I ensured our Monorepo setup could support real-world service development.

K and I broke down the roadmap, I reviewed system designs, mapped out the microservice infrastructure we needed, and worked with the new platform team to build it.

To keep architecture aligned with product needs, I joined early planning sessions.  
In return, I supported delivery planning for the support system itselfâ€”because customer success = architectural success ðŸ˜„

We hit friction along the way.  
That friction sparked a [two-year internal knowledge-sharing initiativeâ€”60+ sessions](/en/posts/knowledge-sharing-journey) that reshaped our team culture. (A story for another time.)

Through this pilot, we built a team capable of handling complex CICD, defining internal code conventions, creating architecture libraries, and delivering services.  
The successful first release of this client-facing system formally established Monorepo as our new standardâ€”and gave the company visible proof of its value.

Other teams soon followed.


## Team-Level and Personal Shift

Ironically, it was the inability to quit that pushed me to find a breakthrough.  
The result? My long-standing goalâ€”**pushing microservices**â€”became reality.

This wasnâ€™t just about scalability or DX.  
It marked a shift for our engineering team, equipping us to take on more complex, evolving challenges.

It reinforced one of my core beliefs in software engineering:

> Resilience isnâ€™t just a goalâ€”itâ€™s a foundation.

By treating this as a training ground, I gave teammates a chance to grow through meaningful challengesâ€”building skills theyâ€™d carry well beyond this project.

That unspoken impact remains one of my proudest deliverables.


## The Outcome

All this started because I refused to sit around doing the bare minimum.  
The projectâ€™s success led to my promotion to **Staff Engineer**.

But with that came a new question:

> Am I *really* ready to be a Staff?
