## Background

In a recent AMA meeting, I was asked, "How do you know when to step into the next phase when learning something new?"

Before answering, I must say I am not a goal-driven person but driven by curiosity. My learning experiences consist of diverse questions that arise naturally—I learn to solve puzzles. I started my engineering journey to better understand my colleagues. I learn out of interest. But back to the question: When do I know it's time to move forward?

I believe it’s when you can solve the problems you face or apply the knowledge you've gained. If you have no specific challenge or question in mind, here are some ideas to consider:

## Ideas

### Level 1 - Solid Foundation

- Do you know the first or most common questions in the domain?
- Can you solve them independently?
- Do you approach them directly or explore different paths?

At this level, you validate that your foundation is strong enough to tackle issues. If you're stepping into a domain out of curiosity, this level helps clarify your personal goal.

### Level 2 - Taste of Major Trends

- Do you know the latest challenges or discussions among enthusiasts in the field?
- Why are these topics trending?
- How do experts perceive these challenges? What are their approaches?
- Do you share similar views or have different opinions?

At this level, you gain insight into major trends and develop personal perspectives on the domain.

### Level 3 - Teaching

- Can you share your knowledge effectively?
- Do you understand the major issues in the domain?
- If you were to teach a session, how would you engage your audience? What would you introduce?

At this level, teaching becomes a way to reinforce and deepen your understanding. No matter your audience's level, you can always find a way to present the knowledge, offering a new approach to learning.

### The overlaps

What overlaps across these three levels? The answer is "problems"—whether challenges, courses, or issues, solving them is key to navigating the knowledge landscape. The first question marks the initiation of knowledge, the common ones reveal why people engage in the field, and recent challenges highlight the latest developments.

## Conclusion

The methods above may not be absolute or the only way to gauge learning progression, but they can inspire you to locate yourself in the learning journey.

Happy learning!
