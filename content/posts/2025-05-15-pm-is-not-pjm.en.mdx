## A Period of Trust and Observation

The first six months after joining a company are often critical—not just for building trust, but also for mutual observation between you and the team.

I still remember how those early months came with back-to-back overtime demands.
Due to two marketing campaigns and a large feature request, I ended up working an extra 20 hours in the first week and clocked 120 hours in the second.

Can anyone really sustain a 120-hour workweek?
I know I can’t.

## Burnout

So when you find yourself in this kind of situation, what would you do?
- A: This place is toxic. Time to bounce.
- B: Call out the team’s issues and hope someone fixes them.
- C: Study what went wrong and figure out how to fix it.

I’d say I’m the kind of person who chooses C.

Of course, not every week was a 120-hour endurance marathon, but the fact that this kind of workload popped up semi-regularly was already enough to feel hopeless.

After recovering from that initial burnout, I took some time off and then ran a retrospection on the project to figure out:
What caused this unsustainable work pattern?

## Digging Deeper

I realized the root cause was simple: no one was managing the workload.
But then, who’s actually expected to take on this responsibility?
It should be the PM, right? (Note: PM here refers to Project Manager.)

Following this line of thought, I began to question:
Why are people with the PM title not managing the project?

Is it because they lack the knowledge or skillset?
Or because it’s not part of their official deliverables, so they’re simply not interested?

## Who Exactly Is the PM?

I decided to schedule a meeting with our CTO to discuss the experience and share my analysis.

Before any improvements could be made, we had to clarify one thing:
Is it a matter of inability, or unwillingness?

The CTO was generally supportive of my perspective, but he made a remark that caught me off guard:
“I don’t know if this helps, but I think the PMs here aren’t really PJMs.”

Honestly, that surprised me.

## Misaligned expectations

In my previous job, I had the chance to work with a Principal PM I truly admired—
Someone who excelled at both Product Management and Project Management.

That experience pushed me to seriously consider:
What skills and mindset should a PM really have?

So I invested time and effort into learning both disciplines.
That knowledge has been tremendously valuable in both my work and personal life.

That said, if the PMs here are solely focused on Product Management, it also implies something else:
This company doesn’t actually prioritize Project Management.
Otherwise, it would already be resourced and tied to career growth.

So if I wanted to drive change, I needed to ensure that introducing project management wouldn't come at the cost of others’ existing KPIs.

## Building a Solution

I started talking to other engineers across the company to learn more about their delivery experiences.

Besides project management being an obvious gap, I also discovered that many stakeholders—
despite regularly making requests—lacked a clear understanding of the end-to-end software delivery process.

If I couldn’t directly change people or their knowledge, maybe I could provide a process template—
one that each team could adjust based on their own context.

That’s where I started.

## From Observations to RFC

I didn’t assume that my experience alone could represent everyone’s view on development workflows.
So I drafted a fairly comprehensive Request for Comment (RFC).

I outlined a chronological task template, with detailed descriptions and reference materials at every step.

The proposal included the background and reasoning behind the initiative, and I invited engineers across the company to review it.
Over the next few weeks, I iterated based on peer feedback—
responding to questions, adapting to different scenarios, and incorporating suggestions.

By the end of a three-week review period, the document had gone through 15 revisions.

It wasn’t perfect—nor did it need to be.
Its purpose was to start the conversation and kick off improvement.

## Putting It into Practice
Our team began using the task template as the foundation for project management.

While it didn’t replace a full-time PM’s flexibility or real-time responsiveness,
it did make a noticeable difference in the development experience:
- Before kicking off work, there was now a checklist to ensure sufficient context.
- During development, discussions had reference points and clear direction.
- If something went wrong, we could revise the template rather than blame individuals.

This layer of structure allowed us to focus on tangible improvements instead of wasting energy on miscommunication or finger-pointing.

## From One Team to Many
Eventually, other teams began adopting the template and even contributed pull requests to enhance it with new checkpoints.

Each team adapted it to their own style and way of collaborating.

The concept also expanded beyond just project delivery into requirement management and cross-functional discussions.

Domain experts could now communicate expectations more clearly,
and their counterparts from other functions could execute more smoothly.

Seeing this evolution was deeply rewarding—far beyond what I originally hoped for.

## Is This What You Hoped For?

One colleague asked me:
“It’s impressive that you singlehandedly changed how the company approaches development.
But now that the process looks so different across teams—does it still align with your original vision?”

I remember replying:
Yes. Because I never expected every team to look exactly the same.
What I really wanted was for diversity to emerge organically—
for it to become a part of the culture.

And that’s 100 times better than simply fixing an uncomfortable workflow.

## Final Thoughts

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth sailing from there.
Every hurdle still had to be cleared, one at a time.

But what I didn’t realize back then was:
This experience revealed the direction of my future career, shaping team culture.

And that, in fact, became one of the key reasons I was later promoted to Staff Engineer.
