Have You Ever Shared Knowledge at Work?

What motivates you to share knowledge at work?
Is it a genuine passion for teaching?
A recognition of knowledge gaps in the workplace?
Or maybe encouragement from a colleague?

For me, the beginning was surprisingly simple.

## I Was Scared But I Said Yes Anyway

I‘m the kind of person who gets nervous easily.

Even though I may look like someone who’s comfortable speaking in public, I know exactly how badly my body reacts on stage-
My speech speeds up, my mind goes blank, my hands and feet tremble, and interactive Q\&As are my worst nightmare.

Despite having some experience giving speeches or hosting events in school, those physical responses never went away.

So why did I start giving public knowledge-sharing sessions in our org?

<Spacer />

You might assume it was because I have a growth mindset.
That kind of person is usually driven to challenge themselves and seek growth.

Honestly, I’m not sure that describes me. And if I’m being truthful, that’s not the reason.

<Spacer />

I only said yes because [V](/en/posts/how-to-steal-from-the-most-expensive-engineer)—our team’s Sr. Staff Engineer—invited me to.
At the time, it didn’t seem like there was much downside, so I agreed.

A few days later, the panic hit: “What did I just agree to?!”
I spiraled into anxiety.

## If I Was Going to Suffer, I Might as Well Make It Worthwhile

So what would you do in that situation?

Would you bail?
Choose an easy topic just to get it over with?
Or try to squeeze as much value out of the experience as possible?

I chose the third path.

Since I had already agreed—and didn’t want to back out—I figured I might as well make this stressful experience worthwhile.

How?

I decided to pick a topic that could do double duty:
Something that would allow me to fulfill the sharing commitment _and_ bring value to my day-to-day work.

## My First Talk

That mindset led to my first session: **Uncertainty Management**.

At the time, I had just realized that [PM ≠ PJM](/en/posts/pm-is-not-pjm).

And without proper Project Management, I saw how cross-functional teams often misunderstood one another due to mismatched expectations and unfamiliarity with workflows.

That insight became the perfect bridge between a topic I cared about and a real organizational need.

<Spacer />

Even though I spent a long time preparing, the delivery was still pretty messy.
And yes—I was incredibly nervous.

But something shifted afterward.

<Spacer />

A colleague came up to chat about how they manage uncertainty in their projects.
Later, I overheard others referencing the time–scope–resources triangle to frame risk discussions.

<Spacer />

That was the first time I truly felt:

> Sharing isn’t just one-way knowledge transfer.
> It’s planting a seed.

And that realization started to change how I felt about public sharing.

## I Started Watching How Others Did It

After participating in a few more sessions, I began observing how others picked their topics and structured their content.

Some sparked discussion.
Some introduced new technologies or perspectives the company hadn’t yet explored.
Some changed how people worked.

That’s when I realized:
These weren’t just presentations. They were **mediums for transmitting culture**.

<Spacer />

So I began sharing more intentionally—topics that reflected both my current responsibilities and my vision for the team’s culture:

- DX optimization strategies
- Micro-frontend adoption and implementation
- My view on what defines a _senior engineer_
- Tactical paths for frontend performance improvements

These weren’t just knowledge dumps.
They were opportunities to explore how we could make the work environment more supportive and sustainable.

I began experimenting:

- What kind of framing would influence decisions?
- What kind of phrasing would spark resonance?

## Culture Doesn’t Only Come from Policy

Gradually, I saw that sharing creates ripples.
Culture change doesn’t always need to come from top-down policies.

Sometimes, it starts with a new idea being seen.
A conversation sparked, a new perspective surfaced.

I was still nervous every time I spoke,
but I started to genuinely enjoy the process.

Because I could see how those ideas lived on.
They fueled conversations, influenced decisions,
and eventually became part of how people worked—
naturally, almost invisibly.

<Spacer />

That experience helped me understand something for the first time:

> Culture doesn’t have to be imposed through rules.
> It can emerge organically—through conversation, sharing, and the flow of ideas.

That was the first time I _concretely experienced_ cultural shaping.
Not through authority, not through process—
but through a single talk, a resonant message, gradually seeping into the team’s day-to-day.

<Spacer />

Looking back, that moment marked a real turning point in my career.

I no longer saw myself as someone who just completed individual tasks.
I began to ask a different question:

“What kind of change can I bring to the team, to this environment?”

That question became the foundation for the work I later did in engineering management and cultural practice.

<Spacer />

Of course, I didn’t realize any of this at the time.
